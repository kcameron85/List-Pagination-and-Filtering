# List-Pagination-and-Filtering
Treehouse Project 2
 
 Project Description: 

This project will take a list of names and dynamically limit the amount of content on any individual page. Names that extend beyond the set limit will be appended to an additional page which is accessed via pagination links at the bottom of the window.
